# Compatibility

#### Linux

Trunk will run on most unix flavors including Ubuntu, Arch and others. We do require glibc version 2.19 or later. Alpine linux is not supported.

#### macOS

Trunk will run on macOS version 10.15 or later. On ARM based machines trunk requires rosetta.

#### Windows

Trunk will run under windows from inside WSL. Future support for native windows support is planned.

### Backwards Compatibility

We generally strive to maintain backward compatibility between the [Trunk Launcher](../reference/components.md#trunk-launcher) and the Trunk binary, but you may need to occasionally upgrade the launcher to support the versions of Trunk.
