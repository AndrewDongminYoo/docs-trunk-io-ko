# What is Trunk?

Trunk is a developer experience (DevEx) toolkit that enables you to ship code quickly while maintaining the guardrails necessary for a large team. Use Trunk for checking, testing, merging, and monitoring your code.

Check out:

* [Trunk CI Analytics](https://trunk.io/products/ci-analytics): live and trend data about the performance and flakiness of your GitHub Actions workflows, jobs, and steps
* [Trunk Merge](merge/overview.md): a merge queue to make merging code in GitHub safer and easier
* [Trunk Check](check/overview.md): an extendable superlinter with a builtin language server and preexisting issue detection
* [Trunk CI Debugger](ci-debugger/overview.md): a real-time debugger for your CI jobs

Use all our tools by logging in to [trunk.io](https://app.trunk.io/). Also, use Trunk Check via:

* [Trunk CLI](cli/overview.md)
* [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=trunk.io)
* [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/trunk-check)
