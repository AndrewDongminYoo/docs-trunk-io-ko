# advantages of Trunk Check's "hold-the-line" feature

**Slide Title:** Beyond Traditional CI Linters: Embracing Precision with Trunk Check

**Slide Content:**

- The common issues with CI linters: false positives and ignored secondary issues
- Introduction to Trunk Check's "hold-the-line" feature
- The significance of comparing code before and after changes

**Speaker Notes:**

- CI linters are great tools, but they often present us with a dilemma.
  On one hand, we deal with an overwhelming number of alerts, including those we're already aware of, slowing us down.
  On the other hand, ignoring issues not directly touched by our changes can lead to overlooking important secondary effects.
- Trunk Check presents a novel approach with its 'hold-the-line' feature.
  It acts as a time-traveling detective, examining the scene before and after your changes, and only reporting the actual differences.
  This precision ensures you're informed about the true impact of your pull request.
- The key principle here is acknowledging the interconnectedness of code.
  A single line change isn't isolated—it ripples across the codebase.
  'Hold-the-line' honors this reality, focusing on the actual issues your changes introduce.

**Slide Title:** The "Hold-the-Line" Philosophy

**Slide Content:**

- Explanation of the "hold-the-line" feature's operation
- Benefits of isolating changes to identify true issues
- The impact of this feature on development workflow and team efficiency

**Speaker Notes:**

- Let's dive deeper into the 'hold-the-line' philosophy.
  It's not about being static; it's about moving forward with awareness.
  It allows developers to introduce changes without the fear of being held responsible for previous code decisions.
- This isolation of changes means your team can be agile and fast, focusing on current tasks instead of being bogged down by historical issues.
- Imagine integrating this into your workflow.
  The noise from irrelevant alerts drops dramatically.
  Reviews become faster and more meaningful.
  And the team's morale? It skyrockets because they're judged fairly, on the code they write today.

**Slide Title:** Trunk Check in Action: Cleaner Commits, Focused Reviews

**Slide Content:**

- Real-world examples of "hold-the-line" improving code quality
- Testimonials or case studies (if available) from teams using Trunk Check
- The overall impact on development speed and quality assurance

**Speaker Notes:**

- Let's consider how 'hold-the-line' transforms our daily commits.
  With this feature, we ensure our changes are not just good but are improvements over the past.
  It's proactive, not just preventative.
- Case studies from teams who've adopted Trunk Check consistently reflect higher satisfaction with the review process, decreased time to merge, and an overall boost in code quality.
- So, what does this mean for you and your team? It means the freedom to innovate without the overhead of legacy issues, confidence in the quality of your commits, and a streamlined, focused review process.
  It's not just about maintaining the line—it's about elevating it.
