# Jenkins

## Compatibility

The minimum supported version for Jenkins is **2.387.3**.

If you need support for older versions, please contact our community slack at [slack.trunk.io](https://slack.trunk.io) or support at [support@trunk.io](mailto:support@trunk.io).

The [Trunk Plugin for Jenkins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/trunk-io/) requires the [**GitHub** plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github/).

Installing the Trunk Plugin will install the GitHub plugin.

## Install the Jenkins Plugin

## Configure the Jenkins plugin

### Copy your API Token

### Configure a Secret for Jenkins

## Upload Data

If for any reason you don't see your pipeline runs in the Trunk app after 3 minutes.

Please contact our support at <https://slack.trunk.io>.

## Troubleshooting

The Trunk Plugin for Jenkins will also log errors to the Jenkins System Log.

You can find these by navigating to **Manage Jenkins** > **System Log**.

If you need additional help debugging, please contact our community slack at [slack.trunk.io](https://slack.trunk.io) or support at [support@trunk.io](mailto:support@trunk.io).
