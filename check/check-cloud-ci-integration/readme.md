# CI Setup

In addition to running locally, Trunk Check can automatically check for issues whenever **pull requests are filed or pushed to a specific branch** in your repo. Trunk Check can also **run periodically** (ex: every night) to check for new vulnerabilities in your dependencies.  To run Trunk Check automatically you must setup the Trunk Check web app to connect to your Continuous Integration (CI) system.

If you are using GitHub see the [GitHub Integration Guide](get-started/).&#x20;

If you are using a non-github CI system, see the [Non-GitHub Integration Guide](continuous-integration/).
