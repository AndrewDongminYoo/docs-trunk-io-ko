# Advanced Setup

The Trunk command line tool can not only manage linters and beautifiers, but also any command line tool, runtimes, and workflow automation actions. You can also share configuration and custom linters between repos with Plugins.

- [Check](../readme.md): linters, code beautifiers, and other tools to check your codebase for pre-existing issues.
- [Tools:](./tools/readme.md) hermetic runtime and CLI tool manager.
- [Runtimes](./runtimes/readme.md): NodeJS, Python, and other versioned runtimes.
- [Actions](./actions/readme.md): local workflow automation and githooks. Used by Trunk Check, but you can create your own custom actions too.
- [Plugins](./plugins/readme.md): repositories of shared code to expand the core capabilities of the Trunk CLI and to share config between different repositories.
